# Pyzeebe & Connectors Example

This project contains
* a process
  * receiving user input
  * calling openweathermap via the REST connector
  * calling a worker for looking up a suited activity for the given weather (via custom template)
  * sending an email to the user via the Send Grid Connector
* a form for the user input
* a worker written in Python, using the [pyzeebe](https://github.com/camunda-community-hub/pyzeebe) client
* a custom template for the worker

This example can be used most easily in [Camunda 8 SaaS](https://console.cloud.camunda.io) with the WebModeler and Connectors provided.

Upload the process model to the web modeler and deploy it to your cluster. Process instances can be started from the Web Modeler.

To run the project, you have to add your personal configuration:
1. Replace the Camunda SaaS credentials in `pyzeebeWorker.py` to match your cluster.
2. Add API keys for Openweathermap and Send Grid as secrets to your cluster. Read more about it in the [documentation](https://docs.camunda.io/docs/components/console/manage-clusters/manage-secrets/)
  * OWM_API_KEY holds the API key for Openweathermap
  * SEND_GRID_API_KEY holds the API key for Send Grid
